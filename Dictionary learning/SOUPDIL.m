%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Function for SOUP Dictionary Learning

%This is an implementation of the learning algorithms used in the simulations in the following papers:
%1) S. Ravishankar, R. R. Nadakuditi, and J. A. Fessler, �Sum of Outer Products Dictionary Learning for Inverse Problems,�
%   in IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP), 2016, pp. 1142-1146.
%2) S. Ravishankar, R. R. Nadakuditi, and J. A. Fessler, �Efficient Sum of Outer Products Dictionary Learning (SOUP-DIL) 
%   and Its Application to Inverse Problems,� in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 694-709, Dec. 2017.

%Inputs
%Y: data matrix with training signals as columns
%D0: initial dictionary
%X0: initial coefficients matrix (sparse matrix)
%l2: parameter for sparsity penalty during learning - the penalty weight is l2^2 for L0 dictionary learning 
%    and l2 in L1 dictionary learning
%numiter: number of iterations of block coordinate descent minimization
%optn: if set to 0, function performs L0 dictionary learning, else it does
%      L1 dictionary learning (see Sadeghi et al., 2014 for OS-DL)
%optn2: when the atom update solution is nonunique, optn2=0 sets the atom to the first column of the identity 
%       matrix. Else it is set to a random unit norm vector.
%ct: if set to 1, the objective value is computed in each iteration
%the parameter L (upper bound on coefficient magnitudes in X) for L0 dictionary learning is assumed very large (inactive)

%Outputs
%D: final dictionary
%X: final sparse coefficients matrix
%obj: vector of objective function values (set to 0 unless ct is set to 1)
